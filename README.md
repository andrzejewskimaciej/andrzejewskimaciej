## Hi there! 👋

I'm Maciej Andrzejewski, Data Science Student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science at Warsaw University of Technology. I'm passionate about programming and working with data. Also I find exploring new Data Science technologies and the underlying mathematical concepts particularly fascinating. In my free time, I immerse myself in literature.

### Projects:

* [Credit Card Fraud Detection - SGH x Mastercard Hackathon](https://github.com/andrzejewskimaciej/Projects/tree/main/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection%20-%20SGH%20x%20Mastercard%20Hackathon) - ML classification model for fraudulent transaction built in team as a submit to SGH x Mastercard Hackaton May 2025. Due to poorly generated dataset, we put the most effort in Feature Engineering step with treating data as *time series* with intent to reflect real credit card operators fraud detection systems;

* [LLM Toxicity Classifier](https://github.com/andrzejewskimaciej/LLM_toxicity_classifier) - an automated tool designed to detect and categorize harmful online content by analyzing context and nuances. Offers dual-architecture approach utilizing Gemini 3.0 Flash for fast, high-precision cloud analysis or a Toxic-BERT accompanied by Llama 3.2 for private, local processing. Built using Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, and Docker.

* [ML Projects](https://github.com/andrzejewskimaciej/ML_Projects/tree/main) - Machine Learning projects including:
  * classification model with a business goal to detect fraudulent transactions in e-commerce;
  * loan customers clustering for advertising purposes;
  * interpretable models for credit risk scoring;

* [PantryBuddy](https://github.com/andrzejewskimaciej/PantryBuddy) - Java recipes book taking into account home supplies. There were used such technologies as Swing, JUnit, SQLite. Also we took recipes from external API;

* [Oral Health Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/andrzejewskimaciej/Projects/tree/main/DataVisualizationTechniquesProjects/Project%201%20%20-%20Poster) - Poster presenting data related to oral health created with the use of R, ggplot2 and Canva;

* More projects coming soon 👀
